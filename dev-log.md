## Day 3

Moving on to image uploading.
We'll be using [uploadthing.com](uploadthing.com) for this project

Create a new app, and grab our secret keys.
Check out the getting started guide in the docs. We'll need to install some packages
`npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react`
The tutorial install include `react-dropzone`, but this is not listed with the current docs, so we'll leave it out for now and come back to it if needed in the future.

We'll be using the app router, so follow the set up for that. Create the core.ts file.

// @TODO
Create the api route file
